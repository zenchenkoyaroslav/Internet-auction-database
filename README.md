# Internet-auction-database
University project on Oracle database subject
There are two scripts: first one for creating users, second one for creating tables; filling tables; creating functions, triggers, procedurs.
After script execution on the Oracle server, we will have a whole system that has online auction management tools.
Of course it will work for auction I came up with, when I was working on the project.
